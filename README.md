# Minikernel
Current version: 0.01

This is the mini kernel! It is a side project of mine, and it is meant to 
run on the raspberry pi 3b, but I would like to make it work on all
raspi devices. That would be a significantly difficulty. 

# Features
It can initialize the raspi UART 1 device, gpio devices, and can print debug
output to the console

# Features Being Worked On
Virtual memory and Page Tables
Simple File System and I-Nodes/V-Nodes
Process Creation
Heap management

# Features Currently Planned
Devices as files
